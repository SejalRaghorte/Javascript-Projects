<h1>Simon Says Game</h1>
<p>This project is a web-based Simon Says game, where players must follow and repeat a sequence of colors generated by the game. With each level, the sequence gets longer, and the player must correctly reproduce the sequence to progress to the next level. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and their score is displayed, along with the highest score achieved.</p>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<p>The game is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript for game logic, including sequence generation, user interaction, and progression.</p>
