<h1>Todo App</h1>
<p>This is a simple Todo List web application that allows users to add tasks and delete them dynamically.</p>
<p>The Todo App is built using HTML for structure, JavaScript for interactivity and DOM manipulation.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The user inputs a task in the provided text box.</li>
  <li>When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the task is added to an unordered list.</li>
  <li>Each task in the list is accompanied by a "Delete" button that allows the user to remove it from the list.</li>
  <li>The delete functionality works on both new tasks and the tasks that were initially rendered on the page.</li>
</ul>
