<h1>Guessing Game</h1>
<p>This project implements a simple number guessing game using JavaScript. The game prompts the user to enter a maximum value, generates a random number between 1 and the entered maximum value, and then allows the user to guess the number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and the user can continue guessing until they get the correct number or choose to quit.</p>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<p>This project uses HTML to structure the webpage and JavaScript to handle the logic of the guessing game.</p>
